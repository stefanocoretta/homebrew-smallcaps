# SmallCaps: Stefano's Homebrew Tap

This is my own [Hombrew](https://brew.sh) tap.

## Install

First add this tap to your brew.

```bash
brew tap stefanocoretta/smallcaps
```

Now you can install `<formulae>` or `<casks>` with `brew install`.

```bash
brew install <formula>
brew install --cask <cask>
```
